# GM Utils

Python3 utils to simplify natural language machine learning code.

A set of tools to make other ML code easier and cleaner.  It's all about the Kolmogorov Complexity, baby!

Note: Most applicable to the scenario I find myself in most often: Working from a Mac but connecting to Ubuntu.

Suggested:
  - python 3.5
  - When on Mac, use venv instead of virtualenv
